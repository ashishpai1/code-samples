Code Samples
============

People who are hiring often look for examples of your code. So I thought I'd make it nice and easy! You'll find examples of my PHP, HTML, CSS and JS code here. Please, please note that these are *examples* and almost certainly don't work stand-alone. They're for purposes of demonstration that I understand concepts as well as showing my coding style.

Also, I can use this as a learning experience. If other folk come across this and notice that I'm doing something wrong or could be doing something better, send me a pull request. I'll read it, learn about what you're suggesting and then implement it. Secondly, having this on GitHub will allow me to see how my style and knowledge improves over time. Either be it through changes to the examples themselves or with the addition of different languages as I add more to my skill-set.
