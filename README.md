Code Samples
============

People who are hiring often look for examples of your code. So I thought I'd make it nice and easy! You'll find examples of my PHP, HTML, CSS and JS code here. Please, please note that these are *examples* and almost certainly don't work stand-alone. They're for purposes of demonstration that I understand concepts as well as showing my coding style.
