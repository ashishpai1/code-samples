CSS Code Sample
================

I am au fait - and prefer to use - a preprocessor to produce my CSS now-a-days. I'm comfortable with both LESS and SASS/SCSS (or however you choose to capitalize those) as well as with tools such as gulp and grunt in order to automate this process.

In this sample is an example of both raw CSS and some SASS which would be compiled into minified CSS for a project.
