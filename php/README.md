PHP Code Sample
================

This is an example of a PHP class used across several of my projects. Hopefully it highlights my fondness for sensibly named variables and methods as well as useful comments using a standard docblock. 

I generally try and embrace the princples of; having few public fields instead making public accessors, handling errors in place, writing objects which are loosely coupled but have high cohesion and wherever possible leverage inheritance.

Please note that this code probably won't work as a stand-alone item, it's more as an example of the style of code I write.
